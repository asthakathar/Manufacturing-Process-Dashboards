Power BI Dashboards for Energy Consumption Optimization
Overview
This repository contains interactive Power BI dashboards created during my internship at Technova Imaging Systems. The dashboards are designed to provide real-time data insights for optimizing manufacturing processes. By leveraging key metrics and visualization techniques, these dashboards helped reduce energy consumption by 15% and improve overall operational efficiency.

Key Features
Energy Consumption Reduction: The dashboard helped achieve a 15% reduction in energy usage through optimized process parameters.
Real-Time Data Insights: Integrated real-time data feeds to track energy usage, production metrics, and process efficiency.
Interactive Visualizations: Enabled users to explore key metrics and insights to facilitate data-driven decision-making.
Tools and Technologies
Power BI: Primary tool for dashboard development.
Data Source: CSV and SQL databases for collecting energy consumption and process data.
